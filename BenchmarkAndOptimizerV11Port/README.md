# TB Optimizer — Timberborn 1.1

This branch contains **only individually switchable gameplay optimizations**. It does not run benchmarks, write CSV/freeze logs or throttle any tick/update systems. It also does not patch the startup dynamic-assembly discovery paths.

- Source and PR map: [OPTIMIZATIONS.md](OPTIMIZATIONS.md).
- The separate [BenchmarkAndOptimizerV11Port](https://github.com/tharbad08/TimberbornMods/tree/chatgpt/BenchmarkAndOptimizerV11Port) branch owns interval controls, protected tick policy, CSV benchmarks and diagnostic profiling.
- The [TBSave](https://github.com/tharbad08/TimberbornMods/tree/chatgpt/TBSave) research branch holds startup crash-guard code and save/load profiling research; the startup guard is not itself a save optimization.

Restart after changing an individual feature toggle. No global dispatcher hooks, broad profiling or per-system sliders are installed by this mod.
